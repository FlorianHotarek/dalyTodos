# dalyTodos
A project for a React Native app to create reusable and child-friendly todo lists. The idea is to have the app available on tablets, mounted on the wall.

## Concept Ideas
- Create a classic ToDo list with text:
  - Create ToDo's with end dates as reminders.
  - Create ToDo's with descriptions.
  - Check off ToDo's when finished.
  - Hide and show finished ToDo's in the list.
  - Delete ToDo list.
  - Share ToDo list.
  - Add ToDo via Alexa (e.g., shopping list).

- Create a ToDo list with images for children:
  - Add images instead of text (one or more).
  - Use a preset of stickers to write ToDo lists.
  - Create a preset of stickers for your lists.
  - Includes all features from a classic ToDo list.

- Create a routine from a list:
  - Routine can be reset manually easily.
  - Routine can be reset automatically by time or date on a daily basis.
  - Create ToDos within a routine that will not be saved.
  - Create ToDos within a routine that will be saved.

- Create a day from some routines.
- Create a week from days.
